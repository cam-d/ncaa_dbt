### Welcome to my Project!

Started this project as part of [Kaggle's 2022 NCAA Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/mens-march-mania-2022/data) and wanted to use [dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/) to build the features used in predicting and analyzing NCAA tournament games. 

Repo Includes:

 - Loading datasets from Kaggle to Bigquery via python script
 - Bulding models in dbt using SQL.
 - Adding additional data from [Ken Pomeroy's site](https://kenpom.com/index.php?y=2002)
